# Grep Folder

*A simple recursive search on Windows.*

## What Grep Folder is

This repository is **Grep Folder**, a desktop utility. A simple recursive search on Windows.

findstr flags are easy to get wrong. ripgrep is not always there.

Files stay on the machine that runs the tool. Originals are left alone unless you choose otherwise.

## What's included

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.

## What it does

- Query
- Glob include
- Skip binaries
- Optional regex

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.

## Desktop build
